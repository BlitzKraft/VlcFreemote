# VlcFreemote
Control your VLC from an Android device. No need to get up from the couch.

How many times have you been comfortably watching a movie from the couch only to find out you forgot the subtitles? How about being snugly tucked under a blanket, only to find out you need to brave the cold of winter just to add a new episode of your latest binge-watching series? Yeah, that can easily ruin your day.

Worry no more: with VlcFreemote you can now install a tiny Android app to control your VLC server.

### Another VLC remote? Why?

There are a few VLC remote controls out there. I think this is the only once that's open source (not 100% sure). It has some nice extra features I haven't found in other remote controls too: 
* Remembers which files you have already played
* Automagic movie-skip (jump forward by a percentage of the file length, much more useful than it sounds!)
* Bookmark management.
* An extra compact layout, specially useful for phones.
* Other small things probably not even worth mentioning.
In the future, whenever I get some free time, I'd like to add the ability to start VLC automatically from SSH, a feature I would use a lot and I have seen nowhere else.
 
### Why isn't this in Google play?
 Mostly cause I'm lazy and cheap. Getting a Google Play account costs 10 dollars or so, and I'm too lazy and too cheap to get one. Want me to upload it to Google Play? Feel free to buy me a beer. If not you can just get the APK from Github, or download the source code and build it yourself.

### TODO
* Auto start Vlc if shutdown when an ssh server is present
* Add widget to control Vlc from a "desktop" (?) widget
* Idem for lock screen?
* Control remote Vlc volume from local volume key
* Add chron job to auto get last status
* Fix current play indicator in playlist view
* Add license
* Publish updated apk to GH
* Publish apk to store?
